      <p>
        Servant leadership is a Christ-centered approach where the leader serves first.
        Jesus modeled this in John 13 when He washed the disciples’ feet, showing that
        greatness in God’s Kingdom comes through humility and love.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our dorms, classrooms, and communities, this posture changes how we organize,
        communicate, and care for people. Leading like Jesus means elevating others,
        stewarding influence wisely, and keeping the Gospel at the center of our work.
